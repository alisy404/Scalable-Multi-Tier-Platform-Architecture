🚀 Multi-Tier Cloud-Ready Application (DevOps Project)

This repository demonstrates the step-by-step evolution of a backend service from a simple single-tier application to a cloud-ready, multi-tier architecture, following real-world DevOps and production practices.

The project is intentionally designed to grow tier by tier, showing why each architectural decision is made instead of starting with over-engineered solutions.

🎯 Project Goals

Build a realistic DevOps project, not a tutorial demo

Show architecture evolution (Tier-1 → Tier-2 → Tier-4)

Prepare an application that is AWS / ECS / RDS ready

Demonstrate:

Containerization

Service orchestration

Environment-driven configuration

Stateful vs stateless services

Startup resilience

🧱 Architecture Evolution (Conceptual)
🟢 Tier-1 — Baseline Service

Single Python API

In-memory data store

Stateless design

Health endpoint

Environment-driven configuration

Purpose:
Establish a functional baseline and understand application behavior before adding state or infrastructure complexity.

🟡 Tier-2 — Stateful Service (Current)

PostgreSQL database added

Persistent data storage

Docker Compose orchestration

Startup retry logic for DB readiness

Purpose:
Introduce state, which naturally justifies infrastructure such as databases, networking, secrets, and fault handling.

🔴 Tier-4 — Cloud-Ready Target (Planned)

Redis caching (ElastiCache)

Async processing (SQS + workers)

Observability (Prometheus / Grafana)

AWS infrastructure (VPC, ECS, ALB, RDS)

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Purpose:
Demonstrate scalability, performance optimization, and production-grade DevOps decisions.

▶️ Running the Project Locally
Prerequisites

Docker

Docker Compose

Start the services
cd app
docker compose up --build

Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/data/1

🧠 Key Engineering Decisions
Why environment variables?

Enables the same container image to run in:

Local

CI/CD

AWS ECS

No code changes per environment

Why retry logic instead of depends_on?

Containers start faster than databases

Real cloud platforms do not guarantee readiness

Application-level resilience is mandatory in production

Why start simple?

Avoids over-engineering

Makes architectural decisions defensible

Mirrors how real systems evolve

📌 DevOps Interview Talking Points

 CI/CD pipeline

✅ Why This Project Matters

This is not a CRUD demo.
It is a systems-first DevOps project designed to show:

How applications evolve into scalable, production-ready cloud systems.
